# PyTorch Tutorial: Neural Network for Iris Dataset

## Overview
This tutorial demonstrates building and training a simple neural network using PyTorch to classify the Iris dataset. The tutorial covers steps from importing necessary libraries to iterative optimization using gradient descent.

## Installation
Ensure you have PyTorch installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:

pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

## Usage

Import Required Libraries:

import torch

import torch.nn as nn

import torch.nn.functional as F

import torch.optim as optim

from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

## Neural Network Components

1. Construction:
Input Layer: Matches the input size of the dataset.
Hidden Layers: Optional layers between input and output layers.
Output Layer: Matches the number of classes in the dataset.
2. Forward Propagation:
Pass input data through the layers to generate predictions.
Apply activation functions (e.g., ReLU) as needed.
3. Backward Propagation:
Calculate gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters.
Update model parameters using optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam).
4. Iterative Optimization:
Use gradient descent or other optimization techniques to minimize the loss function.
Update model parameters iteratively to improve performance.

## Conclusion:

This tutorial provides a foundational understanding of building and training neural networks using PyTorch. Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization strategies to improve model performance.
